<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->


[![Result Images][artgan-interface]]

CS 236G Final Project 

In this project, we train CycleGANs to perform photo-to-painting style transfer to create face filters that transform real images into the style of several painting genres. 

In this repository you'll find:
* A PyTorch implementation of the CycleGAN archhitecture
* Code to run the CycleGAN training process 
* Face image and painting datasets 
* A script to launch an interface to try out pretrained ArtGANs
